# The manual

## Basics

In order to pass the game you need to survive all **rounds**.

A **round** is an encounter with a single **creep**.

Your avatar is controlled by a code snipped that we'll call a **tactic**.

A **tactic** must provide `ChooseCard(s game.State) game.CardType` function. That function is called for every **turn**.

The following tactic is a minimal solution for this (don't expect to get a high **score** with it):

```go
package tactic

import "github.com/golangconf/gophers-and-dragons/game"

func ChooseCard(s game.State) game.CardType {
	return game.CardRetreat
}
```

How to earn **score**:

1. Defeat creeps.
2. Survive all rounds and get a survival bonus.

So, a better tactic actually tries to fight some monsters.

```go
package tactic

import "github.com/golangconf/gophers-and-dragons/game"

func ChooseCard(s game.State) game.CardType {
	if s.Avatar.HP < 10 {
		// If have a Heal card and enough MP to cast it, use it.
		if s.Can(game.CardHeal) {
			return game.CardHeal
		}
		return game.CardRetreat // Otherwise run away
	}

	// Fight only weak monsters and run away from everything else.
	switch s.Creep.Type {
	case game.CreepCheepy, game.CreepImp, game.CreepLion:
		return game.CardAttack
	default:
		return game.CardRetreat
	}
}
```

The [game](https://godoc.org/github.com/golangconf/gophers-and-dragons/game) package contains most information that you'll need while writing your own tactic.
